# blockchain-protocols

A blockchain protocol is the set of rules that govern the functioning of a blockchain network. It specifies how the nodes in the network communicate with each other, how transactions are validated, how new blocks are added to the chain, and how the network reaches consensus on the state of the blockchain.

There are several different blockchain protocols in use today, each with its own unique features and characteristics. Some of the most well-known protocols include:

Bitcoin: The first and most widely-used blockchain protocol, which uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to validate transactions and add new blocks to the chain.

Ethereum: A decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.

Hyperledger Fabric: An open-source protocol for building enterprise-grade blockchain applications. It uses a modular design and pluggable architecture to allow for flexibility in building applications.

Ripple: A protocol for fast, cheap, and reliable international payments, with a focus on the financial industry.

Corda: A blockchain protocol specifically designed for use in the financial industry, with a focus on privacy and inter-operability.

There are many other blockchain protocols in use, each with its own specific features and use cases.
